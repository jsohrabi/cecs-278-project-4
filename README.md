# cecs-278-project-4
This was my submission for Project 4 of my Object Oriented Application Development class. This project was an extension of Project 1 of the class.

I had to create a GUI for the dungeon crawler game. This included adding images for entities and items in the game.
I also refactored the original game by providing more abstraction, inheritance, and interfacing.
Additionally, I implemented several design patterns, including Singleton and Factory patterns.
